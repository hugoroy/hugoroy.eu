            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-yours-stays-yours-oh-really">“What is yours stays yours”: Oh, really?</h1>
                                  <p>[This post is part of a series in collaboration with the BBC Radio 4 “Law in Action,” where we try to debunk some of the myths related to terms of service and privacy policies. <a href="http://tosdr.org/blog/tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree.html">Read episode 1</a>]</p>
                                  <p>This week, we're focusing on another big topic related to terms of service: what's happening to content (e.g. pictures, videos) you upload to a service?</p>
                                  <p>Services usually mention that they're not going to sell your content or that “what's yours stays yours.” Yet, you'd better be careful: there are still many things they could do…</p>
                                  <h2 id="a-very-basic-introduction-to-copyright-and-authors-rights">A (very) basic introduction to copyright and author's rights</h2>
                                  <p>The basic principle is that once a person has created or invested in a work, usually with a minimum of creativity, this person is automatically considered the “author” or the copyright holder of that published work. There are differences around the world, but we can say it's a basic principle under the Berne convention, an international agreement that governs copyright and author's rights laws worldwide.</p>
                                  <p>Such laws bear various justifications: allowing to reward creators for their work and incentivise their production; organising exclusive rights to enable return-on-investments; enhancing creativity to bring benefits to society at large.</p>
                                  <p>If, nowadays, copyright has been discussed at great lengths in politics and the media as a burning issue concerning non-authorised distribution of music and films on the Internet, another significant side of copyright has been mainly overlooked: what's happening to <strong>your</strong> copyright, the rights on your photos, your videos, etc.</p>
                                  <h2 id="how-services-exploit-your-copyright">How services exploit your copyright</h2>
                                  <p>Today, incredibly vast amounts of copyrighted works are published by users on the Web (in the so-called Web 2.0 era of “User Generated Content”) through publication services such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and etc. However, very little has been said about what happens to users' copyrights. The sad truth is written plainly in the Terms: a lot of services are claiming over-broad rights on users' content – while they have absolutely not contributed to its creation!</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li><p>True, with these services, “you retain your rights” to your content. They do not ask for a transfer of copyright ownership, but they mainly ask you to grant them <strong>broad</strong>, sometimes <strong>almost-unlimited</strong>, licenses to your content.</p></li>
                                  <li><p>True, these services do not “sell” your content. What they do is <em>transfer</em> the license you grant them, or they grant <em>sublicenses</em> themselves to third-parties. That means they can give rights on your content to other businesses, without asking you.</p></li>
                                  <li><p>True, users have “agreed” to that. But we know that the current agreement to terms of service is <a href="http://tosdr.org/blog/tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree.html">meaningless</a>, and moreover, for many services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitpic, and etc.), the current copyright license was created when the terms were changed.</p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/#twitter">Twitter</a> can change the terms at any time when they see fit; they can choose to give notification, in their sole discretion, via an @Twitter update or via email. In September 2009, Twitter considerably changed the terms for the copyright license and only gave a very short notice a few hours before the changes applied. Furthermore, if you actually try to go read that email and the blog post it links to, you will notice that Twitter omits to mention the biggest changes to their copyright license. [See our discussion: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/-B4iO-9xHvg/0yoWGoEISrEJ">on the mailing-list</a>]</p>
                                  <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/#twitpic">Twitpic</a> has been able to exploit the rights users have granted them, probably without most users knowing. For instance, when Twitpic realised they could make money off their users' pictures, they <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13372982">changed the copyright license</a> to make a deal with media agency WENN.</p>
                                  <p>When <a href="http://tosdr.org/#instagram">Instagram</a> was bought by Facebook, they only had a limited copyright license that was neither transferable nor sublicensable. At this stage, although Facebook had bought the company Instagram for $1 billion, Facebook could not really benefit from the rights over users' photos. Guess what. When Instagram changed their terms in January this year, they aligned their copyright license to Facebook's (among <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/19/instagram_privacy_everyone_s_ignoring_the_real_problems_with_its_terms_of.html">other issues</a>).</p>
                                  <p>Before January 19, 2013, this is what Instagram wrote about copyright in their terms:</p>
                                  <blockquote>
                                  <p>Proprietary Rights in Content on Instagram</p>

                                  </ol>
                                  </blockquote>
                                  <p>After January 19, 2013:</p>
                                  <blockquote>

                                  </ol>
                                  </blockquote>
                                  <p>(Do not hesitate to have a look back at Facebook's <a href="http://consumerist.com/2009/02/15/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever/">previous copyright licenses</a>)</p>
                                  <h2 id="but-this-is-necessary-for-them-right">But, this is necessary for them, right?</h2>
                                  <p>I have seen some arguments stating that these copyright licenses are “boilerplate” (implying they're everywhere), and that they're really necessary for them to provide you with the features of the service.</p>
                                  <p>But this is not true. First, these copyright licenses are far from standard because there are some vast differences even between similar services. You can see that there are a wide variety of licenses with huge differences that we have <a href="http://tosdr.org/topics.html#copyright-scope">scrutinized</a>.</p>
                                  <p>For instance, the copyright license you grant to <a href="http://tosdr.org/#youtube">YouTube</a> bears no explicit limitation, whereas <a href="http://tosdr.org/#vimeo">Vimeo</a>'s copyright license is explicitly limited to 4 purposes. In addition, the copyright license you grant to Vimeo is neither transferable nor sublicensable, as opposed to YouTube.</p>
                                  <p>To take another example, you can compare the copyright license that <a href="http://tosdr.org/#twitter">Twitter</a> requires with the license for <a href="http://tosdr.org/#identi-ca">Identi.ca</a> or <a href="http://tosdr.org/#seenthis">SeenThis</a>. In case this isn't significant enough, you can also compare Twitter's current copyright license with the copyright license they had <a href="https://twitter.com/tos/previous">before 2009</a>.</p>
                                  <p>Secondly, if it were really necessary for these services to have such broad copyright licenses, I still see no clear reason why they would ask for the possibility to <em>transfer</em> or to <em>sublicense</em> them.</p>
                                  <p>And even if it was a matter of necessity, services could just state it clearly and expressly in the copyright licenses. For instance, <a href="http://tosdr.org/#soundcloud">SoundCloud</a> asks for a copyright license like this:</p>
                                  <blockquote>
                                  <p><strong>To the extent it is necessary</strong> in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences to SoundCloud on a <strong>limited</strong>, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis. <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/_gI8wQ3PZ2M/discussion">Source</a></p>
                                  </blockquote>
                                  <h2 id="which-terms-of-service-are-fair">Which terms of service are fair?</h2>
                                  <p>Do not get fooled. Some businesses <em>do</em> get broad rights on your published content when you “accept” their terms of service. Your content is valuable, you should not blindly accept copyright licenses over them.</p>
                                  <p>Here at ToS;DR, we <em>systematically</em> check the copyright licenses carried in terms of service to find broad language. If you want to avoid giving away your rights, one simple first step can be to <a href="http://tosdr.org/downloads.html">download</a> our web browser extension and instantly check the information regarding the copyright licenses of services you use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="tosdr-in-action">ToS;DR in Action</h1>
                                  <p>During the month of June, the ToS;DR team is collaborating with the BBC on their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tgy1" title="BBC Radio 4Law in Action">“Law in action” programme</a> for a 4-show series dedicated to the <a href="http://tosdr.org/topics.html" title="Topics covered by ToS;DR">topics</a> of terms of service and privacy policies.</p>
                                  <p>On June 4, <a href="http://www.rozenberg.net/">Joshua Rozenberg</a>, Julia Hörnle from Queen Mary University, Jimm, and I talked about what is the probably most unavoidable topic when it comes to terms of service. You can already listen to the <a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/law/rss.xml">podcast</a> on the BBC site. Stay tuned for the next topics, on each Tuesday at 4 pm UK time.</p>
                                  <h2 id="i-have-read-and-agree-to-the-terms-why-is-that-what-we-call-the-biggest-lie-on-the-web">“I have read and agree to the terms”: Why is that what we call the biggest lie on the Web?</h2>
                                  <p>See at 0m53s. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbvwZ4LWeEc&amp;t=0m53s">Video: Eddie Izzard on how iTunes terms change all the time</a></p>
                                  <p>This is a sensitive topic, and it boils down to consent. Consent is a pretty common condition to form binding agreements around the world, but what is it exactly? Clicking “I agree to the terms” or checking that little box: what are the implications?</p>
                                  <p>First, there's absolutely no denying that in its current state, the terms of service acceptance mechanism is deeply broken, for two obvious reasons:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li><p>the terms of service and privacy policies are <em>too long</em> and often do not provide shorter versions, nor do they provide <em>plain-English</em> versions either;</p></li>
                                  <li><p>the average user signs up to lots and lots of online services, sometimes agreeing to multiple documents or services at once because of <a href="http://tosdr.org/topics.html#third" title="ToS;DR about third parties in terms">third parties</a> that can be involved.</p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>In 2008, <a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/#publications">Lorrie Cranor</a> from Carnegie Mellon estimated that it would take 244 hours every year for each individual to read the privacy policies they agree to online. (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/reading-the-privacy-policies-you-encounter-in-a-year-would-take-76-work-days/253851/">The Atantic: 76 work days to read all the terms</a>).</p>
                                  <figure>
                                  <img src="tosdr-in-action-i-have-read-and-agree/books.jpg" title="UK consumer org “Which?” comparing lenghts" alt="From http://conversation.which.co.uk/technology/length-of-website-terms-and-conditions/"><figcaption>From http://conversation.which.co.uk/technology/length-of-website-terms-and-conditions/</figcaption>
                                  </figure>
                                  <p>Second, these two problems are multiplied by the facts that:</p>

                                  <li><p>terms of service and privacy policies change <em>all the time</em> and it's very, very hard to keep track of all of them (although we're trying really hard to solve this by building <a href="http://tosdr.github.io/ToSBack3" title="ToSBack3 is currently in development">ToSBack</a>)</p></li>
                                  <li><p>some services, including major ones, do not even commit to a legal obligation of notifying their users of such changes.</p></li>

                                  <p>Since 2007, Facebook has brought major changes to their longer-than-the-US-Constitution-terms-of-service about <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline" title="EFF: Facebook terms, a timeline">every year</a>. Among the services that do not make it an obligation to notify users of changes: Microsoft, Yahoo!, Skype, Amazon, YouTube.</p>
                                  <p>(Ironically, it seems that the Yahoo! privacy policy has been changed to now make it an obligation to notify users of modifications; however, I do not remember having received notification of this change, although this is the kind of email I pay attention to for ToS;DR. Anyway, I'll have to update <a href="http://tosdr.org/#yahoo">#yahoo</a>).</p>

                                  <p>Before answering these questions, we need to stop for a minute.</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li><p>Courts in different jurisdictions under different laws may come to different conclusions regarding these practices, especially about whether changing terms without notifying users is acceptable or not.</p></li>
                                  <li><p>Just because you live in a society that is usually more protective about your rights, it does not mean you're safe, because a lot of the terms of service have <a href="http://tosdr.org/topics.html#jurisdiction-law">choice of law clauses</a></p></li>
                                  <li><p>Even when such practices would be deemed illegal, it does not mean that they are not doing any harm. Quite on the contrary, if you've got to go see a judge (i.e., taking the burden of litigation on you in time and/or money) it probably means that harm's been done already. Good contracts do not provoke litigation; they ease private relationships.</p></li>
                                  <li><p>And sometimes, even when companies have been fined for practices that have been considered illegal, they have still succeeded in profiting from their actions.</p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>Julia Hörnle put it nicely on the show: “They're getting away with it.”</p>
                                  <p>Now, about terms that can change without notification to you, I suppose they are valid in the US, but they're usually not valid in Europe (which does not prevent companies providing services in Europe to have such clauses in their terms and to continue not to notify users…).</p>
                                  <p>For those interested, there are interesting cases in the UK:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li>Parker v. South Eastern Railway Company (1877)</li>
                                  <li>Thornton v. Shoe Lane Parking (1970)</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>In France, consent is part of the four conditions necessary to be forming a valid contract (article 1108 of the Code Civil). The question is then if the terms of service on websites can be considered &quot;reasonable notice&quot;, and thus be enforceable to the user that has agreed to them. A <a href="http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=jurisprudence-decision&amp;id_article=3534">recent French supreme court decision</a> implies that the acceptance of ToS requires notified consent; merely hosting the ToS online does not create a contractual obligation.</p>
                                  <p>There was also an <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/241354/Terms+of+Service+and+Deceased+Users+Account">interesting case in Canada</a> in which the heirs of a deceased person wanted access and ownership of their brother's email account at Yahoo. One of the questions was around: were the changes to the terms reasonably communicated to the user?</p>
                                  <p>In the European Commission's new data protection regulation currently under review by the European Parliament and the European Council, there's a proposal that the burden of proof of consent be on the service provider.</p>
                                  <p>And that gets me to my last point about consent. In the end, I still have no clear idea what consent actually means in the reality of online services today.</p>
                                  <p>While we have the personal data 1995 directive in the European Union, it seems that there's no enforced consensus at this point about what actually constitutes consent to personal data processing. On the one hand, data protection authorities want to promote interpretations that are in favour or users' privacy. On the other hand, I don't see much happening on how services deal with their users' consent. Let's hope the next regulation will clarify that, and hopefully, not result in less protection or in meaningless consent (see for instance the intense lobbying over the proposed requirement that consent be expressed consent).</p>

                                  <p>Oh, I forgot to answer the question. No, some of these terms are actually illegal:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                  <li><p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/29/whatsapp-privacy">WhatsApp breached data privacy laws by storing non-user contact details</a></p></li>
                                  <li><p><a href="http://www.onlinelaw.de/de/aktuelles/it_news.php?we_objectID=324&amp;pid=0">German Court rules Facebook original Friendfinder and various terms and conditions to be illegal (Landgericht Berlin, Urteil vom 6. März 2012, Az. 16 O 551/10)</a></p></li>
                                  <li><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-07/apple-s-customer-data-privacy-rules-struck-down-by-german-court.html">Apple’s Customer Data-Privacy Rules Struck Down by German Court</a></p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <hr>
                                  <p>So, right now, it's fair to assume that if you clicked &quot;I agree&quot; that means you consent presumably to what's written in the terms; even if that involves <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/17/gamestation-grabs-souls-o_n_541549.html" title="It happened on April 1">selling your soul</a>.</p>
                                  <p>What's problematic is that although terms of service are kinds of non-negotiated contracts, they're still a two-way relationship. There are meaningful things written in there, about your rights and obligations as well, to which you presumably consent.</p>
                                  <p>Every once in a while, when a service brings major changes to their terms, we see some media coverage and sometimes outrage at what services can do or aim to do with our personal data or with our creative content. So, we can assume that <em>people do care</em> about these issues; yet, the I-agree-to-the-terms-circus goes on and on.</p>
                                  <p>My assumption then, is that when we discuss privacy and surveillance in our society today, especially in the context of legal regulation or legal reform, we ought to be careful before making statements about what people supposedly consent to.</p>
                                  <p>Just because Facebook is popular, it doesn't mean Facebook users are actually aware and agree to their practices. Thus, assuming that people are ready to “trade-off” some of their freedom from surveillance in exchange for liking and commenting on pictures, is a very big assumption to make about how people value their privacy and their rights.</p>
                                  <p>Quite to the contrary, I would say we have very little idea in general about what's happening to our rights online and how we're <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo/2013/05/whos-tracking-me-online-the-most-google-or-facebook/">being tracked</a>. Hopefully, ToS;DR can fix some of that.</p>]]></content:encoded>
